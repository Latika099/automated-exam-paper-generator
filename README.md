# automated-exam-paper-generator
This is a console-based C++ project that generates question papers automatically based on user-defined inputs like total marks, difficulty levels, and topic preferences. It uses basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) such as vectors, sets, and file handling to filter and select questions from a pre-defined question bank.

Filters and selects questions from a text-based question bank

Saves the output in a neatly formatted .txt file

Lists available topics on request

Ensures the final question set matches the exact total marks
